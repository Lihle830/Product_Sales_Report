### Product_Sales_Report
This project analyzes daily sales data for a single retail product to measure pricing performance and profitability. Using the dataset “Sales Case Study.csv”, key metrics such as sales price per unit, gross profit percentage, and price elasticity of demand are calculated to understand how pricing and promotions affect overall sales and margins.

### Overview
The dataset contains aggregated daily trading information for one product sold at a large retail store.
Each record represents one day’s activity, including sales, cost, and quantity sold.
### Dataset Description
Each record in the dataset represents one day of trading and includes the following columns:
. Date The calendar day on which the sales occurred.
. Sales Total Rand value of sales that occurred on that day.
. Cost of Sales Total Rand value of costs associated with those sales.
. Quantity Sold Total number of product units sold that day.
### Objectives
Using this dataset, the goal is to develop the following metrics and insights:
. Daily Sales Price per Unit
. Daily % Gross Profit
. Daily % Gross Profit per Unit Promotional Periods & Price Elasticity of Demand
. Identify three (3) periods during which the product was on promotion (e.g., when price per unit dropped).
. For each period, calculate the Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):
. Finally, determine whether the product performs better or worse under promotion based on revenue and profit margins.
### Key Business Questions.
. How does daily profitability vary with price?
. Is the product price-sensitive (elastic) or not?
. Do promotions increase total profit or only sales volume?
### Expected Insights
Relationship between price and quantity sold
Trends in daily and average profitability
Impact of promotions on sales performance

### Tools & Technologies
Databricks / SQL for calculations
Power Point for visualization
Excel for exploration

### Conclusion
By analyzing sales, cost, and quantity data, this project provides insights into pricing effectiveness, demand sensitivity, and profit optimization.
It helps identify whether promotional strategies enhance profitability or merely boost short-term sales.
