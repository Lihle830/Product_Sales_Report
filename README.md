# Product_Sales_Report
This project analyzes daily sales data for a single retail product to measure pricing performance and profitability. Using the dataset “Sales Case Study.csv”, key metrics such as sales price per unit, gross profit percentage, and price elasticity of demand are calculated to understand how pricing and promotions affect overall sales and margins.
